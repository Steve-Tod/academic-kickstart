Hi! I’m Zhenyu Jiang (江振宇). I just received my B.E. from Tsinghua University, working with Jiansheng Chen and Jiwen Lu. I will start my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Texas, Austin. I study computer vison, machine learning. In summer 2019, I had a great time working on learning deformation space as a intern at [Guibas lab](https://geometry.stanford.edu/), Stanford University, supervised by Professor Leonidas Guibas.
